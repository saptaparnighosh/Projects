# Strength Data

This data set contains results from a clinical trial that compares the effect of an intervention on strength. The prospective cohort study enrolled 240 participants and the dataset contains the age, treatment group, and strength of the subjects post-intervention.
The results show that the strength decreases with age but the decrease is less if one is in the treatment group than in the control group.
